# My-Travel-Book
If you are a traveler and love to visit new countries, this app is exactly for you! You can add new places which you like, pin and add comment places you visit in the app and whenever you are, you can go back to these places by using navigation. In this app, I used MapKit and CoreLocation libraries and selected CoreData as my data source. In that regard, I benefited from MKMapViewDelegate and CLLocationManagerDelegate protocols to use the functions which embedded in these protocols. I extracted ID data from the data base to be more accurate and to show in the screen. Besides, I used gesture recognizer to make the app more interactive. Apart from using gesture recognizer, I benefited from Table View and in relation to that UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource were two essential protocols I integrated into my app in order to acquire the list view. Also, to provide the interaction between these two screens, I used segue feature and prepare for segue function.Finally, The current location of the app is arranged as Paris. The users can change their location as they please! Have a nice trip :)
